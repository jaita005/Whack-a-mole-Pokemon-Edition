# Whack-a-Mole: Pokémon Edition

## Description

Whack-a-Mole: Pokémon Edition is a fun and interactive browser-based game inspired by the classic arcade whack-a-mole concept. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this version features a Pokémon twist: Diglett and Dugtrio pop up for you to score points, but be careful—Charmander is a trap! Hitting Charmander will cost you points. The game includes randomized mole appearances, dynamic scoring, and a custom Pokémon-themed UI for a nostalgic gaming experience.
